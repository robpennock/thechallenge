As I sit and try, 
to remember all the things 
I wanted to convey to you,
I come up blank.

Cause seeing you in front of me,
has caused me to go numb. 
I've forgotten all the things, 
I wanted us to overcome.

As I remember, as I remember 
  we were ignorant once, but kids all the same
And do you remember? Do you remember 
 waking up to a world wholly new, or did you resist every change?

Somehow - STILL HERE  
Another wasted year.
This ship is going down, 
but by myself I'll bail it out.
Reflect.  Implode. Just skip it and more on.
This ship is going down, and together we'll fucking drown.  

 I thought there was no way I could  stay, That my dreams  had all been washed away.
No tears or  shades of gray, everything we had was  gone.
 But there is plenty left to say; refuse to live my life that way
 Now fear ignorant days; when everything we built was lost.

This is a clean slate for me, and I won't let this go to waste.
I'll say the thing's I have to say so, Fuck you - Fuck you - Fuck you
This is a clean slate for me, and I know that I have you to thank.
But you won't get credit for everything so, Thank you - Thank you - Fuck you

This ship is still going down, but I will not fucking drown
